#Pipeline for D montium genomes, phylogenetic analysis

#User input genome(s)

#User input gene sequence(s)

#Pipe to liftOver application to find loci in each genome

#liftOver outputs chain files of loci in each genome

#Convert files into FASTA format for use in other programs (alignment, etc)
